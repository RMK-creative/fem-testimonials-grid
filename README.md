### What I learned

For this challenge, I wanted to practice CSS GRID, which I have just reviewed again in the past few days. I've found that when I'm not actively coding, I'm forgetting a lot of things! So I reviewed some material and put it to practice with this challenge.
I didn't have access to the figma or sketch design files for this one, and unfortunately my solution is a little bigger than the design.
